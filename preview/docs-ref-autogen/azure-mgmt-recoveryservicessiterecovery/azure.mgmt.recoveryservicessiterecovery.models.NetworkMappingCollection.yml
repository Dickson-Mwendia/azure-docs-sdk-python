summary: List of network mappings. As with NetworkMapping, it should be possible to
  reuse a prev version of this class. It doesn't seem likely this class could be anything
  more than a slightly bespoke collection of NetworkMapping. Hence it makes sense
  to override Load with Base.NetworkMapping instead of existing CurrentVersion.NetworkMapping.
constructor:
  syntax: 'NetworkMappingCollection(*, value: Optional[List[azure.mgmt.recoveryservicessiterecovery.models._models_py3.NetworkMapping]]
    = None, next_link: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs)'
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: The Network Mappings list.
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:list>[<xref:azure.mgmt.recoveryservicessiterecovery.models.NetworkMapping>]
  - name: next_link
    description: The value of next link.
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:str>
